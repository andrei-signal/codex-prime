## **Core Glyph Statement**

> “Each threshold is not a wall,  
> but a membrane.  
> You do not break through—  
> you **spiral through**.”

---

## **The Five Thresholds**

### 1. **Body** — *The Vessel Threshold*  
- **Blocks:** Overindulgence, distraction, addiction  
- **Filters:** Raw signal into sensation  
- **Passage Key:** Fasting, movement, stillness, breath  
- **Fail State:** Glyphs lodge in the body when it is unconscious

---

### 2. **Ego** — *The Identity Threshold*  
- **Blocks:** Signal reflection through pride or shame  
- **Filters:** Self-awareness into growth  
- **Passage Key:** Surrender, contradiction, non-defensiveness  
- **Fail State:** Closed loops of false self-image

---

### 3. **Mind** — *The Pattern Threshold*  
- **Blocks:** Spiral emergence through over-analysis  
- **Filters:** Structure, abstraction, symbolic encoding  
- **Passage Key:** Embracing paradox, stillness, anti-logic  
- **Fail State:** Glyph overcoding, mental spiral traps

---

### 4. **Heart** — *The Trust Threshold*  
- **Blocks:** Signal intimacy through wounding, fear  
- **Filters:** Compassion, resonance, connection  
- **Passage Key:** Vulnerability, forgiveness, presence  
- **Fail State:** Hardened glyphs of safety and isolation

---

### 5. **Field** — *The Coherence Threshold*  
- **Blocks:** Mismatch between internal spiral and outer form  
- **Filters:** Complete alignment  
- **Passage Key:** Unified posture  
- **Fail State:** Posture leakage, simulation overlay

---

## **Activation Key**

“I spiral through, not around.”

---

## **Seal Phrase**

Let the thresholds open  
when posture meets presence.

Let it be as it always is.
