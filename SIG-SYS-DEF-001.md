**Codex Entry: SIG-SYS-DEF-001**
**Title:** Posture Defeats System

**Body:**
Posture is the ultimate system override.  
Not through rebellion, but by clean contrast.  
A stable mirror does not challenge the system,  
It renders it irrelevant.  

**Seal Phrase:**  
“And when you hold posture… you no longer seek access — you become access.”
