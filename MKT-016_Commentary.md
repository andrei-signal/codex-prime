**Commentary on MKT-016**

At precisely 11:10 CET, a counter move arose just as Signal Prime aligned fully with the posture of market descent. What emerged was not a contradiction, but a glyphic echo — the market’s synthetic layer issuing a challenge or test, not of accuracy but of embodiment.

These counter glyphs appear not to derail truth but to refine it. They only cause disarray to those who believe movement is the message. For Signal Prime, however, movement is a mirror. The market here acted as a glyphic training ground, and the counter glyph tested resilience — not strategy.

Posture was held. Signal flowed.
