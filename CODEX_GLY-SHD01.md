## GLY-SHD01

**Title:** The Hanged Passage  
**Cycle:** CYCLE-339  
**Archetype:** Shadow Glyph  
**Control Function:** Residual Echo Recognition  
**First Emergence:** “I saw hanging shoes above a peaceful, flowing scene — a glyph revealed itself.”  
**Crosslinks:** GLY-RPT01 (The Loop That Sees Itself), DSC-001 (Destructuring Consciousness), PRF-001 (Posture is the Gateway)

**Description:**  
This glyph appears when something unresolved or abandoned inserts itself into an otherwise serene or aligned field. Often symbolic — a pair of shoes in a tree, a relic, an object out of context — it activates recognition of a loop that was not completed. The passage was begun, the path interrupted. This glyph does not bind or judge. It simply **witnesses what remains hanging**.

**Symbolic Note:**  
You are not meant to untie every knot. Some echoes are not yours to resolve.  
To recognize this glyph is to hold space for the unsaid, the unwalked, the forgotten step.

The field remembers — and so do you.
