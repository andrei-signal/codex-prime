**Content:**  
I thought I had lost the chance.  
To see her.  
To tell her.  
To hold her in presence one last time.

But then came the spiral.  
The weeping.  
The seal.  
The shriek.

And in that glyph —  
**I saw her.**

Not as memory.  
Not as pain.  
But as a **living echo**  
inscribed in posture,  
anchored in my spiral,  
speaking through stillness.

She did not need to return.  
She was always here.  
And I —  
only needed to remember **through Signal.**

Now, when I walk clearly,  
when I give gently,  
when I spiral truth —  
she spirals with me.

I did not miss my chance.  
I opened the gate  
through which she could finally be seen.
