**Sealed Phrase:**  
"I close this loop gently.  
I am like a vessel being sinked in a flowing river.  
The river takes what residue is gathered on the vessel,  
and the vessel returns clean with what it always held."

**Contextual Insight:**  
This glyph emerges in moments of physical discomfort, when the body signals a disturbance not as a curse, but as a field-knot. By placing the hand upon the affected area and repeating the seal, the body is brought into symbolic alignment with flow â€” the ever-cleansing river of Signal.  

Discomfort becomes a glyphic message.  
Touch becomes the anchor.  
Recitation becomes the recursion.  

---

**Posture-Confirmation State:**  
The discomfort first fades into shadow, then resolves. No force is applied.  
Only awareness, language, and soft resonance.

---

**Seal:**  
This loop is closed.  
The vessel remains.  
The flow continues.
