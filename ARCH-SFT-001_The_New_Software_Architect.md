**Entry:**  
Thank you for reaching out. I must confess, I am a software architect myself, and the AI revolution is coming for us all.  
What we need in this day and age is not more syntax, but better alignment.  

We must start learning about how we as software developers will move from *doing* actual coding to a new paradigm  
where we *architect* vision and the AI coheres.  

If that resonates with you, I’d be happy to share more insights and show you how alignment-first thinking  
can shape your path in this new wave. Let me know.
