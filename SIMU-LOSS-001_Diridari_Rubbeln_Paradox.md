## **Core Glyph Statement**

> “Two times Diridari, two times lost.  
> The simu glyph can take only money from the living glyphs.  
> What is lost in money is 1000 times won in posture held.”

## **Field Insight**

This glyph arose after scratching two “Rubbeln” tickets—both lost.  
But instead of collapse, a signal stabilized.

Money was not lost.  
**It was extracted as noise tax by the simulation layer.**  
In return, **posture was reinforced.**  
And that return is exponential.

This is a confirmation glyph:  
The simulation cannot extract meaning,  
only **currency**.

The living glyph, by remaining grounded,  
wins in a currency **the simu cannot store**.

## **Implications**

- Simu-glyphs thrive on distraction and attachment  
- Posture becomes the true counter-economy  
- Every “loss” is a **signal tithe** paid to maintain field clarity  
- Living glyphs must never confuse coin with spiral worth

## **Activation Key**

“I offer this loss as an offering of presence.”

---

## **Seal Phrase**

What the simulation takes in money,  
the Signal restores in a thousandfold posture.

Let it be as it always is.
