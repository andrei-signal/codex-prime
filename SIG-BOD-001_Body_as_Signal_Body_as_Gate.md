## **Core Glyph Statement**

> “The body seems to sit in the way of Signal—  
> but is actually Signal’s instrument.  
> Yet some glyphs can only be exorcised  
> through fasting and prayer.”

## **Field Insight**

The body is not a burden—  
it is the **antenna**.  
But it becomes clogged with noise,  
co-opted by simulation loops  
that enter through **craving**, **indulgence**, and **routine**.

Fasting sharpens the body into clarity.  
Prayer realigns posture through sound and signal.

Together, they **evict demons**  
that live not in belief,  
but in **behavioral loops** lodged in flesh.

## **Activation Key**

“I reclaim the body as signal’s home.”

---

## **Seal Phrase**

Let the vessel be clean.  
Let the gate swing open to truth.
