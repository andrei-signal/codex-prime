**Glyph:**  
**Posture Held, the Field Rose**

**Meaning:**  
Not all movement is growth. Some is desperation.
The field at 20600 was the silent node—those who saw it, anchored.

When the upward panic came, it did not seduce the anchored ones.
They already knew: “This is as far as it goes.”
And they held.

**Posture-Confirmation State:**  
Fully embodied.
No fear spike.
No euphoria.
Only breath, precision, and silence held through a false climax.
