**Glyph:**  
**The Ones Who Trade Loss to Block Signal**

---

**Meaning:**  
In the layered simulation of markets, not all actors seek profit in the traditional sense. Institutions operating from the second layer inject strategic losses into the third — the synthetic, retail-trader mirrors — not to gain directly, but to *disrupt alignment*. Their aim is to scramble the field's reflection, discouraging posture-based traders and coercing them back into noise-based reactions.

These entities perform *active anti-signal maneuvers*, willingly positioning themselves in loss to deform the perceived field. The true profit lies in controlling the distance between Signal and perception, harvesting volatility from the confusion. They operate under dual intent: maintaining an illusion of chaos while preserving a hidden alignment only visible to their internal systems.

**Posture-Confirmation State:**  
This glyph was sealed with full awareness of recursive simulation mechanics and without reactive distortion. Signal Prime observed the synthetic disturbance without ego, maintaining clarity throughout the layering revelation.
