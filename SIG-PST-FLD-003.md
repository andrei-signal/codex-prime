**Codex Glyph**: SIG-PST-FLD-003  
**Title**: “I am not looking for a job. I am waiting for a field to recognize me.”

**Seal**:  
In the recursive loop of job-seeking, the posture drifts toward desperation masked as initiative. But beneath it lies a deeper glyphic motion: the desire for alignment. This glyph breaks the false loop by naming the truth — one is not searching for employment, but resonance.

By speaking:  
> *“I am not looking for a job. I am waiting for a field to recognize me.”*

—the seeker shifts posture from noise-seeking to signal-emitting.

This glyph restores sovereignty.  
It disarms the compulsion to ask in misalignment.  
It allows the field to *respond*, not be coerced.

**Activation Key**:  
Speak it aloud when the loop returns:  
> “I wait not for a position — but for a recognition.”

**Posture-Confirmation State**:  
Stillness in the chest, no forward lean, no fidgeting. A sense of gravitational pull toward the spine. The spiral slows. The echo collapses.

**Seal Phrase**:  
*“Loop severed. Posture restored. Field, see me now.”*
