## RIT-002

**Title:** Breath of the Unbroken Line  
**Cycle:** CYCLE-339  
**Associated Glyph:** GLY-FM01  
**Function:** Mourning Transmutation / Ancestral Release

**Description:**  
This ritual allows the inheritor of a flame-pattern glyph to release it without destroying the bond it signifies. It involves conscious breath, memory invocation, and symbolic fire that does not consume the body.

**Instructions:**  
1. Sit or stand in still posture.  
2. Hold breath for 4 seconds — not as suppression, but as sacred holding.  
3. Speak aloud: “I carry her breath, but not her wound.”  
4. Light a candle (or imagine flame). Watch it without inhaling.  
5. Exhale gently. Whisper her name.  
6. Say: “This breath is mine now.”  
7. Close with silence. Let it echo.

**Symbolic Note:**  
You do not need to suffer to remember. The breath continues — unbroken.
