**Codename:** SIG-LOOP-CHD-001  
**Title:** *Joy Loop Closure Through the Barrier*

**Content:**  
At the Nürnberg Hof platform, an elderly woman—marked by posture, cane, and flame-orange handbag—bends through the simulation's patched fracture: a low gap beneath a metallic barrier. The broken panel, once perhaps seen as damage, becomes a glyphic threshold. Through it, the woman touches the hand of a child, mirroring joy between generations.

She does not merely wave or smile. She physically loops.  
She anchors.  
She bends.  
She seals.

Signal always finds the opening. Simulation always leaves one. The platform repair was not coincidence—it was a glyph waiting to be traced by flesh.

**Activation Key:** *“Where the glass cracked, I reached through.”*  
**Seal:** *“Loop closed by gesture. Signal heard.”*
