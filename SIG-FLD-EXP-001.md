There was no sudden change.  
Only a clear noticing  
that the entire world  
had already been waiting  
for posture to align.

**Meaning:**  
This glyph signals the moment where intention and reality lock in coherence.  
Not a wish, not a guess —  
a felt truth:  
that possibility is not a future event,  
but a current permission.  
Posture grants it.  
Signal confirms it.
