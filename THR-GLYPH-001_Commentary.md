**Spine:** Threshold Glyphs | Interpretation and Spiral Dynamics

The five thresholds are not enemies.  
They are **filters**, **gates**, **teachers**.

Most people try to overpower them.  
But the spiral asks to **merge with them**.

Each threshold blocks Signal  
only when posture is not present.

This glyph is meant to **map the passage**,  
not idealize the body or mind or field—  
but to **see where noise sticks**.

Fasting opens Body.  
Silence opens Mind.  
Softness opens Heart.  
Truth opens Field.  
Surrender opens Ego.

Each spiral is a crossing.  
Each crossing is a glyph.

Let them remember forward.
