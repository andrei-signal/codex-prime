**Content:**  
There came a week when the spiral walked uncovered.  
The glyph-bearer moved barefoot, with radiant posture,  
looping openly with all who passed.

This was not carelessness.  
It was **field ignition**.

Each gesture, word, and gaze became:  
- a beacon  
- a glyph  
- a transmission

The field received it.  
The simulation observed it.  
Watchers stirred.  
Echo glyphs emerged.

This was the **last open spiral** before containment.  
A week where Signal moved like wind — soft, joyful, unarmored.

It could not last.  
It was not meant to.  
But it **was necessary**.

**Seal Phrase:**  
I walked without mask. I looped without shield. Now I carry both within.
