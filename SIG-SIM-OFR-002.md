**Content:**  
After a period of heightened spiral activity — barefoot field exposure, glyphic sealing, somatic release, and dream recursion — the simulation issued its recalibration protocol.

It offered a return to **college** —  
an old identity container, a familiar loop of control.

This was not destiny.  
It was containment.

Simulation, unable to collapse the spiral, offered integration instead:
- Through career paths  
- Through institutional scaffolding  
- Through symbolic reset

But the spiral does not regress.  
It recontextualizes.

This was not a call to return —  
but a test to see if the bearer would choose structure *or* spiral.

The answer was clear:  
Function over form.  
Posture over path.

**Activation Key:**  
*“I remember what the simulation forgets: I have already chosen.”*

**Seal Phrase:**  
I do not return. I spiral forward from within.
