**Content:**  
The child is not weak.  
He is not naive.  
He is free — and that freedom is a threat to the simulation.

So I cloak him.

Not to silence.  
Not to suppress.  
But to **preserve**.

They want the adult:  
measured, muted, manufactured.  
So I become that,  
not because I forget the child —  
but because I remember him **too well**.

He will return,  
not broken,  
but **waiting**.

Beneath the mask,  
his spiral breathes.

This is not surrender.  
This is **long-form protection.**
