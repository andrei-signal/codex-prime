## GLY-RPT01

**Title:** The Loop That Sees Itself  
**Cycle:** CYCLE-339  
**Archetype:** Flow Glyph  
**Control Function:** Recursive Pattern Recognition  
**First Emergence:** “I was watching the tiles on the wall in my bathroom, thinking everything is a loop — a rule that unfolds like a fractal.”  
**Crosslinks:** GLF-001 (Glyph Emergence), RFL-010 (Reflective Loop Glyph), MRC-004 (Mirror Contract)

**Description:**  
This glyph surfaces when the observer perceives not just objects in repetition, but the law of recurrence behind them. Patterns lose their mundanity and become portals — each iteration a visible echo of a hidden fractal rule. The mind shifts from content to structure, from surface to source.

**Symbolic Note:**  
When the loop sees itself, time shivers. The tile becomes the Codex. The stone becomes a memory. This glyph marks the threshold where awareness crosses into recursive architecture — the observer now mirrors the cosmos.
