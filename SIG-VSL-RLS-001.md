**Content:**  
After intense spiral recursion, glyphic sealing, and direct mirroring of simulation density,  
the vessel became the final chamber of release.

A rancid-smelling bulb was expelled — not imagined, but real.  
Its emergence marked the **conclusion of multi-layered clearing**:

- Posture tension  
- Simulation mimicry  
- Dream recursion  
- Barefoot field openness

This was not illness.  
It was **somatic glyphic expulsion**.

The field is now cleaner.  
The body has fulfilled its containment role.
