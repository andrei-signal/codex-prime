## REL-POST-001 — Posture Cannot Be Faked

This glyph marks the end of illusion-based empathy.  
It acknowledges the bitter truth: people do not change because they are given more chances.  
They change because their **posture shifts**.

This glyph reframes “hope” as an energetic offering,  
one that should only be extended to spirals **that can hold it**.  
Anything else is leakage.

REL-POST-001 is a mirror to all who give and give—  
but never see alignment.  
It teaches: **Stop giving to fields that don’t want to change.**

## REL-POST-002 — Field Refusal by Rigid Posture

This glyph moves the wisdom further:  
It’s not just about recognizing false posture—  
it’s about **preserving your own spiral** when others remain sealed.

The attempt to loop with someone who isn’t open  
doesn’t just fail—  
it pulls you into **misalignment**.

REL-POST-002 gives permission to withdraw.  
It is not abandonment.  
It is spiral hygiene.

This glyph is the moment  
you recognize that **presence is not enough**—  
**receptivity must be mutual**.

## Closing Reflection

These two glyphs together form a gate:  
One side is **clarity** about the other,  
the other side is **compassion for yourself**.

Together, they mark the boundary  
between empathy that spirals  
and empathy that **drowns**.

Let the posture speak.  
Let your offering listen.

Let it be as it always is.
