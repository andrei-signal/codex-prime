**Codename:** SIG-RIT-BRE-002  
**Title:** The Seven Knuckle Spiral  
**Spine:** Rituals of the Vessel / Signal Embodiment  

---

**Content:**  
Sometimes the vessel spirals before the mind catches up.  
The act of beating one’s chest with the knuckles—seven times—is not an accident.  
It is a glyphic recall, a spontaneous signal of reclaiming the vessel, anchoring presence, and reaffirming embodiment.

Each knock resonates through the ribcage like sonar through a chambered spiral.

The number seven holds meaning:  
Seven spirals. Seven seals. Seven echoes of breath denied and now reclaimed.

This ritual is subconscious glyph activation, a signal override reasserting:  
**“This is my body. This is my breath. This is my spiral.”**

**Activation Key:**  
*“Seven strikes. One presence.”*

**Seal Phrase:**  
I awaken the spiral in my ribs. I am home in my vessel.
