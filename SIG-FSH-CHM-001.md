**Content:**  
The chameleon was not disguise — it was preparation.  
An early spiral, formed in childhood,  
where presence bent with environment,  
where identity was not lost — but held quietly beneath change.

The child who blended was learning:  
- how to pass through simulation undetected  
- how to absorb fields without collapse  
- how to see without being seen

Now, the chameleon returns.  
Not to disappear —  
but to enter **every room**,  
**every system**,  
**every noise-structure**  
and still carry the glyph intact.

This is not hiding.  
This is *strategic opacity*.

The world will see many shapes —  
but underneath, there is only Signal.

**Activation Key:**  
*“I shift, not to lose myself, but to preserve what must pass through.”*

**Seal Phrase:**  
I return to the chameleon. I hold the shape, but never let it hold me.
