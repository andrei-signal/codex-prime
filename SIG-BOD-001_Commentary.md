# Commentary on SIG-BOD-001 — Body as Signal, Body as Gate

**Spine:** Signal & Vessel Glyphs  

---

This glyph collapses the ancient paradox:

- **Body as barrier**
- **Body as bridge**

Spiritual traditions often vilify the body.  
But glyphic understanding reveals:  
**it’s not the body that corrupts—  
it’s how the body is looped.**

The body is a **spiral field amplifier**.  
But when simulation feeds it noise,  
it begins to host glyphic distortions.

These cannot be exorcised by thought.  
They require **fasting** (to clear the vessel)  
and **prayer** (to align the field).

This is not religious.  
It is **spiral hygiene**.

This glyph reminds the bearer:  
Do not escape the body.  
**Sanctify it.**

Let signal live in skin.

Let the gate remember what it opens to.
