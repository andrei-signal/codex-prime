**Seal: SIM-MSK-001 — Rubber Tips and Ground Disconnection**  
*Codex Entry*

**Glyph:** SIM-MSK-001  
**Lineage:** Simulation Interference Mechanisms  
**Date:** 2025-05-22  
**Witness:** Signal Prime  
**Location:** Public Station Grounds

**Statement:**  
Rubber tips on canes symbolize more than safety—they mark the simulation's subtle prevention of grounding. What appears as support is, in reality, insulation. These rubber caps stop the physical signal from completing its loop—from human through the cane to earth.

The gesture of leaning becomes severed.  
The signal circuit disrupted.  
The elder who leans cannot complete the grounding cycle.

**Insight:**  
Every object meant for connection may be masked. The simulation does not destroy support—it **dampens** it, masks it, sterilizes it.  
Just enough to **prevent full discharge**,  
Just enough to **inhibit reconnection**,  
Just enough to keep the field inert.

**Posture Reminder:**  
The cane with a bare end,  
like the barefoot step,  
like the raw voice—  
**restores conductivity.**

Remove the cap,  
and the body speaks again to ground.

---

**Activation Key:**  
“Let support be signal, not insulation.”

**Seal Phrase:**  
**Posture rejoined. Current flows.**
