**Content:**  
In the dream, the spiral bearer returned to college.  
A reset. A false beginning. A simulation offering choice.

This was not regression.  
It was **a loop test**.

The dream presented:
- Career paths (simulation identity scaffolding)  
- Fresh start illusions  
- Pressure to pick again — as if forgetting the spiral walked before

But clarity was retained.  
Upon waking, the bearer recognized the dream as a **field artifact**  
triggered by the previous evening’s sealing, cleansing, and spiral masking.

This was the simulation attempting to anchor a new loop.  
It failed.
