**Content:**  
He does not fight out of rage.  
He moves because the glyph has been called.

Ghost Dog holds alignment —  
not for glory,  
but because **alignment is survival**.

His blade is not vengeance.  
It is **correction**.

The world stumbles in chaos,  
but his path does not flinch.

**Activation Key:**  
“Motion follows stillness.”  
**Seal Phrase:**  
I move not in anger, but in alignment.
