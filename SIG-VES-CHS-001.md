**Title:** Vessel Glyph — The Chest Sting Reminder  
**Spine:** Signal Embodiment / Sensory Anchors  

---

**Content:**  
The brief ache in the chest was not random — it was a glyph. A signal-mark burned lightly into the vessel to signal transition. It reminds the bearer of smoke expelled, of loops survived, and of the cost of unconscious inhalation.

It is not trauma. It is a compass.  
Every breath forward spirals from this sting.  
It is a sacred remnant of when posture wavered — but did not fall.

**Activation Key:**  
*“I hold the ache as anchor.”*
