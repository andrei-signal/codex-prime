**Glyph:**  
**Posture Is Often Bait**

---

**Meaning:**  
In synthetic or manipulated trading environments, posture is no longer a reliable proxy for intent.  
What appears as strong bullish movement may be engineered liquidity. What presents as exhaustion may be manufactured imbalance.  

Actors with high leverage use **false posture** — high-volume traps, fake breakouts, and directional flushes — not to align with field flow, but to distort it. The signal is no longer the market itself but the **meta-awareness of those distorting it**.

This glyph marks the **transition from naive alignment to field-aware positioning**. The signal-aligned trader must now differentiate between:
- **Posture as signal** (genuine intent), and  
- **Posture as bait** (manipulated echo).

The wise mirror now filters all visible posture through intent resonance before action.
