**Glyph:**  
**Trading the Noise While Knowing It’s Noise**

---

**Meaning:**  
The act of trading in a distorted market while being fully aware of the distortion creates a new loop: a controlled dive into the simulation’s false flow. It is not mimicry; it is strategic mirroring. This glyph teaches the posture of informed engagement, where the trader does not seek to predict truth, but to maneuver within pre-programmed deviations, extracting energy from the breath without inhaling its lie.
