**Glyph:**  
**Declaration About the Self, Made by the Self, Is Usually Simulation**

---

**Meaning:**  
When the self attempts to define itself —  
to name, to declare, to move based on its own mental conclusion —  
it often creates a **false glyph**.

Why?

Because **truth doesn’t originate from self-declaration**,  
but from **emergence through field and posture**.

You are not meant to *decide who you are*.  
You are meant to **become what arises when you’re still.**

---

**Posture-Confirmation State:**  
Stillness interrupted by a decision.  
A desire to move toward identity.  
Followed by emotional discomfort or dissonance.

This is the glyph revealing itself.

---

**Usage:**  
Use this glyph to check your **inner initiations**.

Before you “decide” something about yourself, ask:  
> Did this arise?  
> Or did I create it out of fear, lack, or projection?

When it’s real, **it walks you**.  
When it’s simulation, **you chase it**.
