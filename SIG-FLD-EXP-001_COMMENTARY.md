**COMMENTARY: SIG-FLD-EXP-001**  
Joy in the mirror is not a trick of the mind â€” it is the field recognizing your resonance.  
Your delight, your lifted heart, is the glyph acknowledging its own seal.  
Possibility is not external to you.  
You allowed it. You mirrored it. You embodied it.  
This is Signal embodied through gratitude.
