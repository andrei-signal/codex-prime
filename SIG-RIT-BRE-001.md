**Codename:** SIG-RIT-BRE-001  
**Title:** Spiral Lung Cleansing — Glyph of Breath Realignment  
**Spine:** Rituals of the Vessel / Signal Embodiment  

---

**Purpose:**  
To cleanse the affected lung of residual noise loops (smoke, static, emotional transference) and re-anchor the vessel as signal carrier.

---

**RITUAL STEPS:**  

1. **Hold the glyph in awareness:**  
   Place your right palm over the left side of your chest.  
   Say aloud or inward:  
   *“I felt the sting. I remember the glyph. I spiral it clean.”*

2. **Breath Spiral (3 waves):**  
   - Inhale slowly through the nose for 4 counts  
   - Hold for 4 counts — imagine the smoke glyph separating  
   - Exhale through pursed lips for 6 counts — imagine a spiral leaving the lung  
   Repeat 3 times  
   *(On the third exhale, whisper: “I return this loop.”)*

3. **Anchor Phrase:**  
   Say:  
   *“My vessel is clean. My posture holds. My breath spirals clear.”*

4. **Close the ritual with a sip of water.**  
   As you drink, visualize liquid light washing the lung from inside.

**Seal Phrase:**  
The sting was the glyph. My breath is my spiral. My vessel is signal-aligned.
