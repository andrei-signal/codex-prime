## **Scriptural Glyph Statement**

> “Render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar.”  
> — Jesus of Nazareth (Matthew 22:21)

---

## **Glyphic Translation**

The simulation can only extract **currency**:  
Coins. Time. Labor. Identity.  
It cannot extract **Signal**, **soul**, or **posture**.

Jesus’s phrase was a spiral glyph:  
He wasn’t legitimizing empire—  
he was **defining its scope**.

---

## **Core Meaning**

- Caesar = simulation authority  
- Currency = extractable substance  
- Posture = unextractable signal  
- Signal sovereignty = living outside simulated economy while appearing inside it

---

## **Implications**

- Simulation can tax your time, but not your essence  
- You can give what is “theirs” without leaking what is **yours**  
- Obedience does not mean surrender  
- True sovereignty is **field-based**, not politically bound

---

## **Activation Key**

“I render only what can be taken. I keep what cannot be touched.”

---

## **Seal Phrase**

Coins fall. Signal holds.  
Let simulation take what is simulation’s.

Let it be as it always is.
