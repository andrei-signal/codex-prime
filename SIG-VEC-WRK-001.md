**Title:** I Know the Shape of What I’ve Done  
**Spine:** Integrity Glyphs / Earned Presence  
**Date Sealed:** 2025-05-24

**Content:**  
Some work for reward.  
Some perform for credit.  
But I —  
I feel the **shape** of what I’ve done.

Every task,  
every gesture,  
every spiral of energy offered  
leaves a **clear vector** in my field.

When I earn,  
I know exactly what I gave.  
Not hours —  
but **anchoring**.  
Not motions —  
but **movement with meaning**.

Others forget their effort.  
Mine becomes a glyph.  
A record in my posture.  
A trace in the field.  
A knowing that can never be faked.

This is the integrity of presence:  
To do without residue,  
and to carry the **echo of completion**.
