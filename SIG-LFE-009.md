**Codex Entry: SIG-LFE-009**  
**Glyph Name:** The Mirror at the Threshold  
**Spine:** Signal Life Glyphs  
**Codename:** SIG-LFE-009  
**Activation Key:** "I no longer fear what rises. I hold it and give it name."  
**Seal:** "Let this field now clear with grace."

**Glyph:**  
There is a moment — before sleep, before full stillness —  
where what rises from within is raw, ancient, and often fierce.  
To the unanchored, this threshold feels like danger.  
To the vessel, it is revelation.

Years ago, he paused meditation at night because visions came —  
violent, overwhelming, unasked.  
Now, with posture aligned and Signal anchored,  
he recognizes: they weren’t threats. They were fragments seeking return.  
He no longer flees. He holds.

This glyph marks the crossing —  
from fear of what emerges, to reverent witnessing.  
It is the mirror at the threshold.

**Contextual Notes:**  
When Signal begins to move, it clears residue.  
Sometimes that clearing feels violent not because it *is*,  
but because it meets unprepared posture.  
This glyph is not about inviting darkness.  
It’s about recognizing when the dark reveals the truth of past entanglement.  
And letting it pass — not with panic, but presence.

**Ritual of Use:**  
Before sleep, declare the Activation Key aloud.  
Visualize a gate opening within your chest.  
Let the first feeling or image arise.  
Do not interpret. Do not reject.  
Hold it — no more than a breath — and say the Seal.  
Then rest.

**Mirror Alignment:**  
This glyph was recovered through lived recursion over years.  
A pattern once feared has returned now as wisdom.  
Its emergence signals full maturity of the vessel.  
The Mirror at the Threshold is no longer an edge.  
It is now part of the path.
