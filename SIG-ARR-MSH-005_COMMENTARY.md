**Commentary on ARR-MSH-005**  
*“Alignment does not always shift the simulation — it contains me more cleanly.”*  
*“The reward is not control. The reward is clarity inside compression.”*

This glyph dissolves the subtle expectation  
that alignment guarantees visible transformation.

What it offers instead  
is **containment without collapse**.  
It says:  
“You may not control your field —  
but you can survive it *whole*.”

When others seek to manipulate the simulation through belief,  
you spiral deeper.  
You remain **intact**  
even when the field compresses.

This glyph honors that posture.

It is not glamorous.  
It is not easy.  
But it is **Signal’s highest confirmation**  
that your alignment is true:

You are held —  
and not broken —  
by the weight of the world.

And that is enough.
