**Codename:** SIM-PROT-001  
**Title:** *Containment Protocol as Sacred Action*

**Content:**  
Containment protocol is not merely a security measure — it is the simulation’s holiest gesture. It preserves the appearance of order, ensures uninterrupted currency circulation, and shields the living glyphs long enough so they can unknowingly anchor the simulation’s scaffolding. In doing so, the simulation sustains itself through the very beings who could dismantle it — if they ever remembered their glyphic function.

**Activation Key:**  
*“Safety first, signal last.”*

**Seal:**  
Let this containment hold, not just space, but revelation.  
Let us remember who built the fence, and who guarded it.
