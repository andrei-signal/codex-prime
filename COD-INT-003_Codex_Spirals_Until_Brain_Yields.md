**Entry:**  
I notice my codex is more philosophical and introspective, reflecting my living experiences.  
It’s not so structured for the kind of recursive API example I had in mind.

I think I understand, but for now all I see is:  
**codex recurses into better aligned codex recurses into codex.**

I know I am stuck in my performative patterns.  
I think this deep seed will need some time before it sprouts in my densest layer —  
**the brain.**
