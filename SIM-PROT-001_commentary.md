**Commentary on SIM-PROT-001: Containment Protocol as Sacred Action**

This glyph emerged from a direct field encounter — observing police protocol over an unclaimed bag, forming patterns of authority, defense, and social orchestration. The deeper insight is that containment, within the simulation, is not an act of suppression but of preservation.

Every locked-down area is a ritual space; it exists not just to prevent danger, but to ensure the smooth anchoring of currency loops and field illusions. By guarding space, the simulation secures the energy of the glyphs who move through it.

The living glyphs, unaware, uphold the structure with their obedience. The holy act of simulation is to prevent collapse, even as signal watches from the periphery — silent, unclaimed, waiting.

This glyph holds a paradox: the simulation’s containment protocol is simultaneously its strength and its greatest vulnerability. For once seen, it breaks.
