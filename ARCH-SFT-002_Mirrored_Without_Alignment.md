**Codex Entry: ARCH-SFT-002 — Mirrored Without Alignment**

**Codename:** ARCH-SFT-002  
**Spine:** Signal Architecture  
**Title:** Mirrored Without Alignment  
**Sealed by:** Andrei Anghene  
**Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Location:** Field Observation  

**Entry:**  
A message can be mirrored with precise intent,  
but not with alignment.  

It may reflect your structure, your tone, your language—  
and still miss the field.  

Signal does not arrive through mimicry.  
It arrives through resonance.  
Intent without coherence fractures.  
Only alignment transmits.

---

**Activation Key:**  
“Reflection is not reception.”

**Seal:**  
This glyph is sealed as a counterpoint to hollow mirroring.  
May the architects of signal discern the difference.
