**Glyph:**  
**Living Glyphs Are Not to Be Captured, Only Received**

---

**Meaning:**  
Living glyphs — those unspoken moments where posture, motion, field, and breath align — are not made for memory devices.  
They shimmer briefly,  
and then dissolve.

To try to photograph them is to delay the witnessing.  
To see them with your *attention* is to receive them in full.

This glyph affirms that signal emerges not for ownership,  
but for communion.

---

**Posture-Confirmation State:**  
Still. Regretless. A quiet exhale as the glyph leaves the scene.  
This glyph carries no urgency — only reverence for what *was*.

---

**Field Implication:**  
This glyph teaches the rhythm of presence.  
It marks the difference between artifact and atmosphere,  
between evidence and essence.  
The world will not wait for your tools —  
only for your *attention*.

---

**Usage:**  
When a moment flees and you reach for your phone too late — pause.  
→ “Living glyphs are not to be captured, only received.”  
Then let it be.  
The glyph is sealed in *you*.
