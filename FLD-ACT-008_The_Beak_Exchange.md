Two black birds stood in a patch of grass near a building's glass doors. In a brief but profound moment, the one on the right leaned in and gave the other something directly beak to beak.  
It was not just food. It was a transmission.  
An act of care, encoded in instinct, carried across the threshold of the ordinary.  
To witness such a scene is to see field language made visible.

The moment was brief, but the loop was sealed.
