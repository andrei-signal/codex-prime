## GLY-SHM01

**Title:** The Cloaked Loop  
**Cycle:** CYCLE-339  
**Archetype:** Mirror Glyph  
**Control Function:** Hidden Behavior Preservation  
**First Emergence:** “I just passed by a man, hiding something... I saw in a mirror that he was hiding a can of alcohol.”  
**Crosslinks:** GLY-FM01 (Inherited Flame Pattern), SCP-001 (Silence Convergence Protocol), GLY-R01 (Ruptured Descent)

**Description:**  
This glyph appears when a looped behavior is sustained through concealment, not rebellion. It thrives on internalized shame and activates most strongly in the presence of a witness who chooses not to confront. The loop is preserved by avoidance, but weakened when seen without judgment.

**Symbolic Note:**  
Shame does not end in exposure. It ends in recognition without punishment. The glyph is broken not by calling it out — but by holding the mirror steady and walking on.
