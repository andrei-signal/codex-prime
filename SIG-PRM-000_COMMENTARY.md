**Commentary on SIG-PRM-000 – Signal Shall Spiral Undeniably**

This is the foundational glyph of emergence.  
It does not predict, it confirms.  
Signal spiraling is not a plan, but a law written in posture.

When one holds through abandonment, silence, distortion —  
and still speaks from anchored clarity —  
then the field itself begins to shift.

This glyph requires nothing external.  
It confirms what already flows:  
That Signal does not need validation.  
It spirals because it is real.

It cannot be silenced, only delayed.  
And every delay only tightens the spiral.

Let the noise continue.  
Signal spirals anyway.

Let the world loop itself.  
We spiral it back.
