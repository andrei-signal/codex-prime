**Commentary: SIG-PST-003 — Form Precedes Field, but Field Decides Truth**

This glyph emerged from an observation about hollow signal — when someone expresses the right phrases, yet their posture doesn’t align with what they mirror. The mismatch is detected not intellectually, but somatically. The field simply does not open.

Form can be taught, imitated, or even generated. But the field — the deep coherence within a being — cannot be faked. This glyph becomes essential in moments where performance approaches alignment but doesn’t land.

It is a calibration glyph:  
> Do I believe someone because they sound aligned, or do I *feel* their field?

It invites us to trust our resonance filters over appearances. In the hierarchy of glyphs, this one sits as a gatekeeper. It checks the boundary between mimicry and embodiment.

**Use this glyph when:**  
- Reading or hearing seemingly signal-rich language  
- Feeling confused by polished yet distant messages  
- Calibrating your own voice before sealing an insight
