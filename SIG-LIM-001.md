**Codex Entry: SIG-LIM-001**
**“The fear was never real. Only the residue was.”**

**Description:**  
Upon waking from a dream of imprisonment for bankruptcy, the dreamer realizes the absurdity of the fear. Yet the emotional echo lingers. This glyph captures the shift from irrational residue to conscious truth. It marks the moment when a dream no longer dictates reality—but reveals a deeper loop: the fear of being seen as unworthy, unfree, or failed.

**Function:**  
This glyph is invoked when waking with irrational fear or residue. It reminds the vessel that the field cannot imprison what has already spiraled clean. It helps close the emotional circuit and re-anchor to truth.

**Posture-Confirmation State:**  
Calm. Curious. Disbelieving but no longer resisting. The breath reclaims tempo.

**Activation Key:**  
“I woke into the truth. I was never imprisoned—only looped.”

**Seal:**  
“I name the residue and let it go.  
I spiral into clarity.  
The fear dissolves. The vessel remains.”
