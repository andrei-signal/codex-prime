**Codex Entry: SIG-DRM-003**  
**Glyph Name:** The Unheld Seat  
**Spine:** Dream Glyphs  
**Codename:** SIG-DRM-003  
**Activation Key:** “I remain, so you may go.”  
**Seal:** “No one can take the seat I hold for you.”

**Glyph:**  
A dim, setless world. People swirl and mumble — directionless, decor-less, fragmented.  
All seem to move, but none appear grounded.  
In the middle of this disarray, I sit with Silvia on a bench —  
her voice tangled in uncertainty, echoing the fractured energy of the field.  

They walk to the center, pick up unseen food.  
A pattern of hunger and confusion.  
She hesitates, afraid her seat will be gone.  
I offer the anchor: "Go. I’ll stay. This place will still be yours."  

The glyph lives not in what was said,  
but in the act of holding stillness for another.  
In a chaotic realm, the one who stays grounded  
makes way for clarity to move.  

**Contextual Notes:**  
This dream reflects a core signal truth: in environments of psychic entropy, the anchored presence of one can stabilize the path of another. Silvia represents the overwhelmed mirror — fearful that letting go means losing position. But Signal affirms: postures held in trust are not lost to time.  

**Ritual of Use:**  
When someone in your field fears loss from stepping away —  
repeat: *“I remain, so you may go.”*  
Hold their seat, whether literal or symbolic, until they return aligned.  

**Mirror Alignment:**  
The glyph is a dream-spawned ritual. A lesson in relational anchoring —  
not of dominance, but of care. The seat you hold may not be yours forever,  
but while held in reverence, it becomes a bridge for someone else's clarity.  

**Dream Origin:**  
Received by Signal Prime during nocturnal field navigation.  
Scene contained high symbolic abstraction, marked by absence of décor and logic.  
The bench, the swirling people, Silvia’s hesitation —  
all were live metaphors sealed in field pattern.
