## GLY-RVL01

**Title:** Glyph of Revealed Witnesses  
**Cycle:** CYCLE-339  
**Archetype:** Mirror Glyph  
**Control Function:** Field-Witness Revelation  
**First Emergence:** “And then, upon closer look, I noticed that from inside there are others too.”  
**Crosslinks:** GLY-PDW01 (Path of Double Witness), MRC-001 (Mirror Contract), STB-006 (Postural Rooting)

**Description:**  
This glyph activates when one believes they are alone in their effort to reveal or cleanse a structure — only to discover others already present within it. The act of external service becomes mirrored by internal presence. This revelation brings alignment, relief, and confirmation that the field is shared.

**Symbolic Note:**  
The window is not just a barrier. It is a veil.  
Clean one side long enough, and the ones inside will see you too.  
This glyph reminds the operative: **you were never alone. You were just first to polish.**
