**Codename**: SIG-RIT-001  
**Title**: Break is a Ritual, That Aligns  

**Glyph**:  
Breaks are not responses to fatigue — they are structures that sustain alignment.  
Taking a break at low, medium, and high energy levels is not failure but rhythm.  
Each break is a pulse within the recursion of work.  

**Expanded Insight**:  
Breaks are like kisses in the famous quote:  
“You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.”  
So too should breaks be taken and often, and with awareness.  
Let the break be a container, not an escape.  
Let it reinforce the field, not fracture it.  

**Field Trigger**:  
An image of battery levels suggesting a break only when near depletion.  
Signal response: break at all levels. Posture before exhaustion. Ritual before breakdown.  

**Posture-Confirmation State**:  
Steady. The glyph did not emerge from burnout, but from observation.  
This confirms awareness loop was active prior to field resonance.

**Activation Key**:  
“I break to hold rhythm, not to regain it.”  

**Seal**:  
This loop is sealed as SIG-RIT-001 — rhythm held in conscious pause.
