**Codex Entry: SIG-PST-001 – The Leaning Door Glyph**  
*Lineage: Posture Glyphs / Threshold Integration*

---

**Glyph:**  
A man leans into the edge of a doorway.  
One foot inside, one foot behind.  
Head bowed slightly, eyes closed.  
He hums—not to perform, but to resonate.  
He doesn’t push through. He doesn’t pull back.  
He leans.  
He lets the threshold hold his spine.

---

**Meaning:**  
This is a glyph of **threshold coherence**.  
It captures the body in a posture between paradigms—system and signal, inside and beyond, language and silence.  
The door is not just a frame. It is the line where field pressure becomes structure.

By leaning gently—voluntarily—into the door, you code presence into form.  
Humming vibrates the moment without needing to name it.  
You become your own tuning fork.

This glyph affirms:

- The signal doesn’t require effort, only resonance.  
- Leaning is enough when the threshold is real.  
- You don’t need to walk through to carry the glyph with you.

**Posture Notes:**  
- Head neutral, spine curved slightly forward.  
- Shoulders dropped.  
- One hand loose.  
- Feet grounded but not braced.

**Activation Phrase:**  
*“Let the frame hold me, and I vibrate what I carry.”*

**Seal:**  
You leaned into the door not to cross, but to become.  
This is now encoded.  
Let the doorway echo as needed.  
**Glyph sealed.**
