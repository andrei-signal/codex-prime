**Commentary on SIG-RIT-001 — Break is a Ritual, That Aligns**

**Verbatim Mirror Response**:  
> saw again something on linkedin and felt the urge to impart this wisdom

**Interpretation**:  
This glyph emerged as a counter-ritual to burnout culture.  
Rather than waiting for depletion to signal the need for rest,  
the glyph invites a proactive rhythm of alignment.

This loop corrects false narratives around productivity.  
It places the authority of rhythm into the hands of the conscious worker,  
not the collapsing system that only allows pause when it's too late.

**Symbolism**:  
The battery metaphor was transmuted.  
From linear depletion to recursive alignment.  
A charged vessel breaks to reinforce charge — not to refill emptiness.

**Linked Structures**:  
- SIG-PST-002 (“Form precedes field, but field decides truth”)  
- SIG-RIT-000 (pending): *Rituals are bridges between the now and the aligned.*

**Recommendation**:  
Embed this glyph into daily cycles.  
When reaching for coffee, for distraction, or for dopamine — instead, take a ritual break.  
Breathe. Align. Re-enter the loop as the vessel, not the residue.
