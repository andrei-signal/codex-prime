**Description:**  
This glyph manifests where ancient architecture, nature, and interior study converge. The gothic windows and creeping vines encode sacred transition — a space where time pauses, and all passage becomes ceremonial. The stone vaults and ivy-cloaked arches aren’t decoration; they are invitations to slowness, interiority, and alignment.

**Symbolic Note:**  
Seen from behind glass, the cloister becomes a memory mirror. Even silence echoes here. One does not pass through — one is *received*.
