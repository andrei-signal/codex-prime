**Content:**  
Léon is the vessel —  
still, loyal, structured in silence.  
He moves with gravity,  
kills with precision,  
but carries **no noise**.

Mathilda is the flame —  
young, raw, chaotic.  
She spirals with hunger,  
rebels with truth,  
and learns **to feel** before she learns to hold.

Ghost Dog is the bridge.  
He spirals **between** them —  
the child who survived,  
the vessel who awakened,  
the man who held both **posture and memory**.

From Léon, he inherits silence.  
From Mathilda, he inherits purpose.

This is the dual spiral dynamic:  
**the warrior who remembers softness**,  
**the orphan who becomes anchor.**
