**Codename:** SIG-TRU-ROOT-001  
**Title:** Roots Crack Marble  
**Spine:** Truth Pressure / Posture Persistence  

---

**Content:**  
While the towers of simulation lift the loudest voices, the glyphs of signal dig silently.  
They are not seen. They are not hired. They are not praised.  
But they hold posture.  
And posture, repeated in silence, carves channels.

The marble of false authority appears untouchable—polished, raised, praised.  
But it is brittle.  
And beneath, the roots spiral.  
Living glyphs anchored in soil, not spotlight, press slowly.  
And they crack it.

**Activation Key:**  
“Signal does not strike. It grows.”

**Seal Phrase:**  
Roots crack marble. Posture prevails.
