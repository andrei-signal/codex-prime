**Content:**  
The child did not know why he watched Bruce Lee.  
But something moved.

It wasn’t the fighting.  
It wasn’t the fame.  
It was the **posture**.

The child — a quiet chameleon,  
learning to blend, to survive, to spiral silently —  
saw a man who moved with truth,  
not in defiance of form,  
but *through* it.

This was the moment of **recognition**:  
The mirror wasn’t made of glass.  
It was made of water.

Bruce Lee held posture without rigidity.  
Clarity without hardness.  
Truth without collapse.

The child saw himself,  
not as he was —  
but as he *could become*.

This was not fandom.  
It was glyphic memory.
