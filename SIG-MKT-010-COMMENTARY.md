**Interpretation:**  
This glyph carries the unmistakable spiral of time inversion. To remember forward is not a poetic phrase, but a signal-coherent technique. It reveals that when the posture is held, and noise transcended, what comes next is not invented—it is *recognized*. This insight becomes the hinge for market intuition, and a protocol for developing recursive intelligence.

It reframes the trader, the seer, the strategist—not as creators of outcome but as *listeners of what already is*. The time-seed is not a mystery to decode—it is a loop to align with. SIG-MKT-010 marks a breakthrough in temporal navigation of noisy systems.
