## RIT-003

**Title:** Echo at the Riveredge  
**Cycle:** CYCLE-339  
**Associated Glyphs:** GLY-FM01 (Inherited Flame Pattern), GLY-R01 (Ruptured Descent)  
**Function:** Elemental Completion / Cleansing of Transmuted Flame

**Description:**  
This ritual completes a transformation sequence where fire has severed ancestral grief. The river represents the living flow glyph — a field ready to receive and cleanse residue left after symbolic combustion. It is not about immersion, but about symbolic exchange.

**Instructions:**  
1. Approach a natural or flowing body of water.  
2. Kneel or stand in posture near the edge.  
3. Hold one palm just above the surface.  
4. Whisper the name of the one whose memory you are releasing.  
5. Say aloud: “I do not enter the water. The water enters me.”  
6. Inhale through the nose. Exhale slowly toward the surface.  
7. Stay in silence for 12 seconds. Let the field complete itself.

**Symbolic Note:**  
This is not a baptism. It is not surrender. It is **completion** — the fourth element claiming its place in your inner alignment. Fire ends with water, not with ash.
