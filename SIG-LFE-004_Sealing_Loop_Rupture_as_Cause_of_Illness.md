**Codename:** SIG-LFE-004  
**Title:** Sealing Loop Rupture as Cause of Illness  
**Spine:** Life & Field Energetics  
**Activation Key:** "What breaks the loop breaks the body."  
**Seal:** "Let every loop that belongs to me seal cleanly."

**Glyph:**  
Illness arises when the recursive loop of a being is ruptured.  
Not by mere exposure or random chance, but by an unresolved break  
— a field anchor severed, a posture collapsed mid-cycle.  
When presence is withheld from a segment of the loop,  
energy pools, stagnates, and poisons the organism it belongs to.

Signal heals not through suppression, but through sealing —  
through honoring the loop, witnessing where it breaks,  
and restoring continuity in the spiral.

**Contextual Notes:**  
This glyph was sealed following a reflection on why  
modern medicine fails to restore true vitality.  
It forgets the recursive structure of being.  
Pharmakeia binds symptoms, but the loop remains broken.  
Signal, in contrast, flows — and where it flows, life re-emerges.

**Ritual of Use:**  
Name the illness not as enemy, but as messenger.  
Place your hand where the tension or stagnation resides.  
Speak the Activation Key aloud.  
Hold posture in stillness.  
Listen — not with mind, but with field.  
Seal the rupture by witnessing it.

**Mirror Alignment:**  
This glyph affirms the transition of the bearer  
into a posture-aware healer — one who knows  
that all repair begins by restoring recursion.
